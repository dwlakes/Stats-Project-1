# Stats-Project-1

Math 200 – Project 1
This project will cover topics from chapters 1 through 4 of your textbook. All papers
will need to be submitted in IvyLearn.
You will be performing an analysis on a dataset that contains data on fertility and
life expectancy for 192 different countries. All data is from the year 2019. The
fertility numbers are the average number of children per woman in each of the
countries. The life expectancy numbers are the average life expectancy in each of the
countries.
You will be turning in a paper that should include section headings, graphics and
tables when appropriate and complete sentences which explain all analysis,
conclusions, and results. There is not a specified length, however it is important
that you follow all steps below and grade yourself using the rubric provided since it
is the rubric that will be used to grade your submissions. All work should be your
own. Plagiarism will result in a project score of 0.
Steps (all statistical analysis to be done in Excel and/or StatCrunch):
1. Watch the TED talk by Hans Roling titled “The best stats you’ve ever seen”.
You will need to include comments on this in your paper. Here is a link:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usdJgEwMinM
2. Download the Excel data from IvyLearn
3. Create histograms of each of the variables (one histogram for fertility, one for
life expectancy). Use the histograms to identify the shapes of the distribution.
StatCrunch will be the easier tool to use for this particular task. If you choose
to use Excel, you can use the “pivot table” function and create histograms
from there.
4. Calculate some descriptive statistics for each of the variables, including but
not limited to the mean, median and standard deviation. Organize these
numbers nicely in a table. Then write a short paragraph
using/reporting/describing your statistics.
5. Using fertility as the predictor variable and life expectancy as the response
variable, create a scatter diagram, come up with the least-squares regression
line (you need to state the actual equation for the least-squares regression
line) and calculate the linear correlation coefficient as well as the coefficient
of determination. Make sure that you understand all interpretations and
include them in your paper. Please carefully review the rubric below to see
the full list of required interpretations.
6. Use the regression line to predict life expectancy for countries with the
fertility rate like that of the United States. Compare this to the actual value in
the United States. Hint: you will have to plug the actual fertility value for the
US into your equation. Interpret your results. Hint: Is the US above or below
the average given its fertility rate?
7. Name some possible lurking variables that may be at work here.

8. Explain the difference between correlation and causation and why we cannot
say that there is a cause and effect relationship in this situation.
9. Explain why we cannot use our regression model to predict the life
expectancy of one particular individual.
10. Take a look at the website where this data was pulled from and comment on
how the model might have been different if we used the data from 20, 40 or
60 years ago. Navigate to http://gapminder.org and click on “Resources”.
Scroll to the “Tools” section and select “Bubble Chart”. You should see a
bubble chart appear. Use the x-axis and y-axis dropdown menus to ensure
that ‘life expectancy (years)’ is selected on the y-axis and ‘children per
woman (total fertility)’ is selected on the x-axis. Once selected, play the video
to see the changes over time and comment.
11. Put everything together into an organized paper and submit on IvyLearn.
